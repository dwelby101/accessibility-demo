        What is accessibility?
      </h2>
      <p>
        "Accessibility means access. It refers to the ability for everyone, regardless of disability or special needs,
         to access, use and benefit from everything within their environment.
          It is the â€œdegree to which a product, device, service, or environment is available to as many people as possible."
      </p>
      <h2>
        What does accessibility try to address?
      </h2>
      <p>
        When developing with accessibility in mind there are key areas that need to be taken into account, these include:
          <ul>
            <li>Visual</li>
            <li>Motor/mobility</li>
            <li>Auditory</li>
            <li>Seizures</li>
            <li>Cognitive/Intellectual</li>
          </ul>
