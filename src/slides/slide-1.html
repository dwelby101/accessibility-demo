        What is accessibility?
      </h2>
      <p>
        "Accessibility means access. It refers to the ability for everyone, regardless of disability or special needs,
         to access, use and benefit from everything within their environment.
          It is the â€œdegree to which a product, device, service, or environment is available to as many people as possible."
      </p>
      <h2>
        What does accessibility try to address?
      </h2>
      <p>
        When developing with accessibility in mind there are key areas that need to be taken into account, these include:
          <ul>
            <li>Visual</li>
            <li>Motor/mobility</li>
            <li>Auditory</li>
            <li>Seizures</li>
            <li>Cognitive/Intellectual</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>
        How can we create products that cater for these areas?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The most widely recognised guidelines are those provided by WC3 and are known as <b>"Web Content Accessibility Guidelines"</b> or <b>WCAG</b>.
        WCAG are organised around four core principles:
        <ul>
          <li><b>P</b>ercievable</li>
          <li><b>O</b>perable</li>
          <li><b>U</b>nderstandable</li>
          <li><b>R</b>obust</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          Note: WCAG is only a guideline and should be used inline with real user testing and good user experience.
